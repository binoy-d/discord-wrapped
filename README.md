A discord analytics backend and frontend. Visualizes data about a discord
server through pretty graphs and interactive widgets. 

## How to run locally
Make sure you have NodeJS to run the client
Make sure you have python3 and flask installed to run the server

For now, just open terminal and run the following, one after the other
- ```cd /path/to/scum-wrapped```
- ```cd client```
